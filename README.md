# hlf-swarm

This project extends the hyperledger fabric working to multiple nodes. This has been achieved using docker swarm.

The application is currently running 3 Orgs with 2 peers each. The network is expandable for upto 7 Orgs. 
All nodes are on the same subnet.

This project has been built on Skcript's multinode hlf network. Check it out on: https://www.skcript.com/svr/setting-up-a-multi-node-hyperledger-fabric-network-with-docker-swarm/
